# This tutorial will cover the basic usage of Asari on the commandline as a standalone program. 

#############################################
# Assumptions and Data Organization Details #
#############################################

# Asari requires that all of the mzML files you wish to process be located under one directory.
# All mzML files should be of the same ionization mode and similar in chemical composition. For example,
# if you have feces and plasma samples from the same study. You should process each type of sample
# separately. 

################
# Installation #
################

# additional details on installation are found here: https://github.com/shuzhao-li-lab/asari_pcpfm_tutorials
# you will need Python3 installed and the ability to install packages using pip, contact your system administrator
# for help installing Python 3 on your system.

# now that you have python3 and pip, let's install asari. 

`pip3 install asari-metabolomics`

# if successful, you can now run:

`asari`

# and get an output with the usage of the tool:

"""

"""

# if you have an error to the effect of 'command not found', more than likely the python bin directory is not on your 
# $PATH environmental variable. This can be fixed by running a command like: 

`export PATH=<python_bin_dir>:$PATH`

# where <python_bin_dir> is the location of your python install's bin directory, on my Mac it is located at:

"/Users/mitchjo/Library/Python/3.9/bin/:$PATH"

# Example Data #
################

# Now lets download the example dataset we will be using in this tutorial:

"https://github.com/shuzhao-li-lab/data/blob/main/data/MT02Dataset.zip"

# To download, push the button in the bar above 'view raw' to the left of the pencil icon.

# now you will need to unzip it using the appropriate tool for your OS.
