# To understand and master asari and pipeline in 1 hour

[in work]





## The pcpfm pipeline

Asari is a Python program for high-resolution LC-MS metabolomics data preprocessing, geared for reproducibility and performance (https://github.com/shuzhao-li-lab/asari). The design is explaiend in Li et al. Nature Communications 14.1 (2023): 4113 . 

A fully featured pipeline, pcpfm (https://github.com/shuzhao-li-lab/PythonCentricPipelineForMetabolomics), has been developed to automate all steps in data processing, including QC, annotation and data wrangling. Here's the paper describing the data structures and pipeline: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011912 .

This repo hosts the tutorials for asari and pipeline.

Notebooks that will be demonstrated during the workshop are available under 'tutorials'. Please look for the 'open in colab' badge at the top of each ipynb to run them in google colab. This requires no installation on your system to test out the pcpfm.

## Installation (System Preparation)
Asari and the pcpfm requires python3 and several python3 libraries.
